# Backend Courses Service
This is a backend service made as a task for Youverse Learning.

## API Documentation:
Note that I allowed the CORS origin to be usable by anyone, so you can test routes in details in your own Postman client.

Visit [this link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/37899717/2sB3BHkoUi) for full documentation.

## Small Demo Testing Some API Endpoints
Main advantage of this is the video playback preview.

## NOTE
Please read the API documentation, it has everything I assumed and requests/responses examples.

Note that currently DRM isn't enabled, since it requires a wait queue/list to get the DRM beta version.
Other websites don't have DRM even as a free-trial that worked with my own credit card. So I did this using the same streaming service but without using the DRM-enabled option.
However when I get the beta release (probabbly after couple days), it'll be very easy to just generate DRM tokens and pass/receive along the requests.
